## 🔧 Key Features

- ⚡ **24 V Power Input**  
  Input via screw terminal, regulated by a **Buck converter** to safely power the Nicla.

- 🔄 **Integrated RS485 Transceiver**  
  Robust half-duplex serial communication, suited for industrial use.

- 🔗 **Dual Power/RS485 Connectors (IN/OUT)**  
  Enables **daisy-chain** connections between multiple devices.

- 🔥 **120 Ω Termination Resistor**  
  On-board line termination, selectable via jumper.

- 💡 **Status LEDs**  
  - **Power LED** for board status  
  - **User LED** controllable from the Nicla (for debug or signaling)

- 🖨️ **Designed with KiCad 9**  
  Fully open-source hardware project.
